ROADMAP DSA STUDY !!
because my english so bad, so i'll study english tho 


i use this website (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial) as a reference for my study

(the things written here are things that I have learned day by day)


DAY 1 *Introductions*
know the basic data structures and algorithms
what is data structure?
what is algoritms?

DAY 2 *What should i learn to master DSA*
learn about complexities
  in this case i learn how complexities works, there have 2 type of complexities:
    -Time complexities : to measure how long times i take to execute some codes
    -Space complexities : to how much space i take to execute some codes

there are have some another keyword 'auxiliary complexities' it's very commonly found during DSA study.
  Auxiliary complexities are refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
